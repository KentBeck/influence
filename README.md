Some programmers have outsized impact through the work they personally do. Others have impact by how much they influence the work of others.

These scripts attempt to roughly point in the direction of identifying these two kinds of impactful programmers. ***BEWARE*** If there are *any* incentives attached to data generated by these scripts all further decisions based on that data is complete bullshit.
