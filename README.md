Some programmers have outsized impact through the work they personally do. Others have impact by how much they influence the work of others.

These scripts attempt to roughly point in the direction of identifying these two kinds of impactful programmers. **_BEWARE_** If there are _any_ incentives attached to data generated by these scripts all further decisions based on that data are complete bullshit.

Run the scripts with a git root directory:

- created_per_creator.sh <git repo> -- prints a histogram of number of creators creating numbers of files
- edits_per_file.sh <git repo> -- prints a histogram of number of files changed a certain number of times
- edits_and_creates_per_creator.sh <git repo> -- kind of the cross product of the two--for each creator, the number of files they created & the total number of times all those files had been changed by someone other than the creator
